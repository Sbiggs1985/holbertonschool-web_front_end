<h3>What is lexical scoping in JavaScript:</h3>
<p>Lexical scoping refers to the way variable access is determined by the position of the variables within the code.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lexical scope: Lexical scope means that the scope of a variable is determined at the time the code is written and remain unchanged during runtime.</li>
  <li>How it Works: When you declare a variable inside a function, that variable is accessible within that function, and any nested functions inside it can also access the same variable. However, the variable is not accessible outside of that function or its nested functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lexical scoping is fundamental to how JavaScript handles variable scope and helps to create a clear and predictable environment for managing variables in your code.</p>
